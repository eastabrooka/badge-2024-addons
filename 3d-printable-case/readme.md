# Official 3d Printable Case for the 2024 EMF Camp Badge

## Introduction
The design decisions for building this case were simple:
- Retain as much of the artwork visibility as possible
- Protect the edges and allow placing the badge down without the board touching surfaces
- Be as easily printable as possible

## Individual Parts
The case comes in several sections and the top and bottom sections are attached with screws. 

### Top Case
This is attached with the existing assembly screws and should be a simple fit

### Bottom Case
This comes in two main varieties (with some options available as I finish the designs). 

The first being a regular bottom bumper. If you are using a USB-C cable as your lanyard this is good to go as-is but there is also a version with an in built loop for attaching a lanyard or caribiner. 

The second version has space for adding six 6mmx3mm magnets (sourced relatively easily from the internet and common enough that you may have some kicking around the workshop). This not only allows you to easily attach your badge to a whiteboard, set of shelves, friendly robot, etc but also allows for other addons and stands!

### The Screen case
This comes in two parts that friction fit together. It is important to get a snug fit and as such you may need to adjust the print size of the "Screen Shim" part in your slicer. My printer prints it snug as is but others have has more success upping it by a percent or two.
